# Pear Expansion

**Pear Expansion** is a small Minecraft mod that adds various features, blocks, items, and tweaks — just things I felt like adding.

## 🍐 Items

  A basic fruit item that restores 4 hunger points and 0.3 saturation. Can rarely drop from oak and dark oak leaves *(0.5% chance)*.

  A special pear that restores 4 hunger points and 1.2 saturation, is always edible, and grants:

    * Regeneration II for 5 seconds
    * Absorption I for 2 minutes

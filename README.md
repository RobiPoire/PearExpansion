⚠️ **Mod in development** — I add things when I feel like it. In other words: it’s not finished, and I don’t know when it will be.

# 🍐 Pear Expansion

**Pear Expansion** is a small Minecraft mod that adds all kinds of stuff — blocks, items, random features — just things I thought were fun to make. No special theme, just… pears, some chaos, and strange ideas.

## 🎯 Ideas and goals (list 100% subject to change):

* Pears (normal, golden, enchanted golden… because why not?)
* **Vertical slabs** (with everything: fire, fuel, oxidation, textures, breakable… the full package)
* Magic potions to **grow** or **shrink**
* Boots (or maybe an enchantment?) to climb one block easily, like horses
* A **wedding ring** that gives a buff when your partner is close… but if one dies, both die 💔
* Works with **Fabric** AND **NeoForge**
* A quest/objective system to stop your survival world with friends from flopping after 2 weeks
* Maybe a new ore to craft really original stuff (still thinking…)
* And surely more weird ideas to come…
